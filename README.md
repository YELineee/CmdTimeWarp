üßêIt's a Cmd History Visualizer built with python and daydream

## Notice
The project is still in the early stages of development

The inspiration comes from `cargo cmdwarpper`

Still working on it that 

## Dream

I might take until the end of 2024 to complete this project. 

It will be divided into two parts
-  First part involves rendering images on a frontend webpage
   -  just like u copy a JSON or another file that you can visualize on the website for ur zsh or .
   -  like u can download a img about it or sth else
   -  may be a dashboard with echarts? i hope so
-  Second part will involve creating a command-line interface similar to cmdwarpper
-  it may  take some time or fking long time i dont know 
-  just wait for the miracle && MonkaS
